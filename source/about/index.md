If I had to explain my current situation, where I am in life and where I hope to end up, then I propose this drawing to better illustrate my points! As an artist and sculptor, I like to communicate visually, which makes sense because as well as being creative-minded, I am also profoundly deaf (I lip read well but I am prone to giving nonsensical answers when I haven't heard the question!). I am under no illusions as to how difficult it is to transfer from one profession to another, and having a disability on top of this had made me even more determined to find my way around problems and limitations. This has been my world ever since I was a child; determinedly problem-solving my way around life and work situations.  Like most creative people, I like to explore different mediums to express my ideas, which in turn gives birth to a few brick walls and some exciting solutions.

For me, approaching coding is mentally no different to approaching sculpture, for example, ceramics; different clay types, kiln temperatures, different responses to certain glazes. In some respects it’s similar with coding; a varied range of languages, methods, and end products and being able to forsee what is needed to create the final outcome.






## Skills





#### Front end

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Node.js, React.js, Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch


During my time at Makers Academy, I have been able to explore my fascination with front-end development, though the course also gave me extensive experience in the back-end development aspects. Experience of both has given me a much better understanding of how the web works, such as database theory, TDD. The course emphasised the importance of being an independent learner and since completing Makers Academy, I have been able to expand on my own projects that focus more directly on front-end skills, involving HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Jquery.

#### Creativity

In my artistic practice, I have collaborated with clients, galleries and produced solo shows displaying my work. I have also experienced a role as an artist in residence, during which I have taught secondary school pupils how best to expand there artistic practice with some technical help too. I like to communicate, collaborate and produce fun stuff. I have been shortlisted for various competitions such as the Royal Summer exhibition and Threadneedle prize. I have had work sponsored by companies such as Rowse Honey, to whom I had to first present my idea; a piece of art, promoting awareness of the endangered honey bee, which I entitled “Honey I’m Doomed”.  Either I pitched well, or they were just extremely worried about the bees, but either way, I managed to gain their support for the project. I am no stranger to collaboration and I love being part of an ‘ideas factory’, where a group can all bounce off each other’s creativity. I was recently in a collaboration with an artist friend and we created a mobile gallery, displaying work for charity: http://thewhatgallery.com; as a part of this venture, we placed several porcelain sculptures of a refugee child around Oxford.

## Experience

**Sculptor** (2008 - 2017)    
*Freelance sculptor* Fabricator, Blacksmith, Ceramics, Wood, Stone, Graphic Design, Illustration
Portfolio: http://michaelgbrown.co.uk, http://thewhatgallery.com
As a freelance Sculptor/Artist I have worked in all sorts of design related areas from client based commissions to gallery sales. I have a breadth of experience in graphic design, illustration, painting, stone, wood, marquetry, ceramics and metal forgery. I have also run school-based workshops for GCSE and A-level students.

**Artist In Residence** (2014 - 2017)   
*Mary Hare School*
I was invited to participate as a artist in residence at the Mary Hare School for the Deaf, during which time I was able to obtain my own studio space. Part of the role was to help with assisting the Art Department with various technical or sculptural requirements. I was also required to teach pupils how to sculpt and develop their assessed portfolios. It was great fun being able to work in such an inspiring environment.

**Art Technician** (2010 - 2013)
*Windsor Boys School*
To help supplement my income as an artist, I worked Part-time as an Art Technician at the Windsor Boys School, assisting the Art Department with everything from tutoring, lesson preparation, exhibition hanging along with managing stock, orders and budgets. Being organised, being able to work to deadlines and having a sense of humour was paramount.

**Blacksmith** (2008 - 2010)
After graduation, I wanted to develop some more metal-working skills, such as forging and blacksmithing (which remain a big hobby of mine). I worked on a castle restoration project with a master blacksmith before moving into my own studio with a forge.
